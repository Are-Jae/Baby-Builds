    <h1>The Artist Always Known As Legend</h1>
    <p>
        A boy of small stature and big dreams entered the world June 7th, 1958, one of what would soon become eight children. He was already on the path of stardom being that he was named after his father’s stage name “Prince Rogers”, when asked why Prince had been named after his onstage persona his father stated that he wanted his son to do everything that he was unable to do.
    </p>
        <p>
            Writing his first song “Funk Machine” on his father’s piano and essentially writing, composing, and producing his first album at age 19, he had already superseded his father’s expectations for him.
        
        </p>
        <p>
            By age 26, Prince had released three successful and critically acclaimed albums including what some would consider to be his magnum opus: Purple Rain. The simultaneously released album and film of the same name made Prince a household name and planted the seeds of his illustrious legacy.
        </p>
    <p>
        Beginning the late 1980s and continuing throughout the rest of his career, Prince began to gravitate towards other genres of music outside of rock, rnb, pop and funk most notably embracing hip hop/rap as he had not done in the previous decade. This experimentation was met with mixed reviews but ultimately cemented his status as an artistic genius able to adapt and transcend music and fashion trends at any given time.
    </p>
       <p>

    The 2000s saw Prince collaborating with younger artists, encouraging their growth. Prince is and always will be the blueprint for showmanship and being a true multihyphenate: singer, composer, producer, multiinstrumentalist, dancer and actor.
</p>
        <p>
            At the time of his untimely death Prince had sold a little over 150 million albums, won a total of 93 awards throughout his career not including honors and completed 29 tours. If there was ever a word that could truly describe his greatness it would be legend. In honor of what would be his 64th birthday I’ve compiled a list below of my favorite Prince songs, though there are many I will keep the list to seven songs, what most fans would consider his favorite number.
